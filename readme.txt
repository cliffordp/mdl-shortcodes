Making it easy to use MDL components in WordPress via shortcodes

== Description ==
Making it easy to use MDL components in WordPress via shortcodes. Material Design Lite (MDL) components are viewable at http://www.getmdl.io/components/
Integrates with https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-ui/ so building shortcodes (even ones with complex options) is super easy!

= Highlights =
* Extremely lightweight and optimized by Google!
* Easily use all the MDL Components' features by using the Shortcode UI (available for most but not all MDL Components)
* Most shortcodes appear in Visual Editor for live preview, avoiding the need to preview every change by visiting the front-end.
* No WP_DEBUG messages
* Actions and Filters available for developers and advanced customizations
* Responsive plugin developer

= Complimentary Plugins =
These plugins may come in handy when building or customizing a site with MDL Shortcodes:
(may contain affiliate links)

* [Easy Google Fonts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-google-fonts/) - to override MDL using [Roboto](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto) font by default
* [WP Views](https://wp-types.com/home/views-create-elegant-displays-for-your-content/?aid=5336&affiliate_key=Lsvk04DjJOhq) or [Shortcode Factory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-factory/) - to output post info (Views is paid and much more powerful but Shortcode Factory is free)
* [amr shortcode any widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amr-shortcode-any-widget/) - can come in handy if wanting to display widgets in an MDL Grid/Cell

== Installation ==

After automatically installing to wp-content/plugins/:
1. Install the Shortcake (Shortcode UI) plugin (you'll be prompted to do so if it's not already installed and activated). It's optional but highly recommended.
2. Click the "MDL Shortcodes Options" wp-admin menu item (next to "Appearance" menu item) to select your MDL colors.
3. Then just use the shortcodes in any Visual Editor (e.g. Post/Page edit screens). With Shortcake (Shortcode UI) plugin activated you'll be able to click "Add Media" then "Insert Post Element" then select one of the shortcodes to customize.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Work with my theme?
The styling of all these components is essentially self-contained. This plugin loads the styles, scripts, and font(s) needed and nothing more. Unless you have a theme that is based on MDL, these components will be styled as seen at http://www.getmdl.io/components/

== Screenshots ==
1. MDL Shortcodes settings in the WordPress Customizer. Get there by clicking the "MDL Shortcodes Options" wp-admin menu item (next to "Appearance" menu item).

2. Shortcodes render in the wp-admin Visual Editor when Shortcake (Shortcode UI) plugin is active.
